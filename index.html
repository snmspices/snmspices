    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>At SNM Spices, we don't just pack powders — we preserve purity. What started as a humble flour mill in 2008 in Vilayur village, Kerala, has grown into a mission to deliver truly chemical-free, unadulterated spices to families who care about their health.</p>
    <p>Our founding belief is simple: “If we feed our families with love, we must feed them with purity too.”</p>

    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>SNM Spices is a family-run initiative rooted in tradition and health. Our father started a small flour mill in 2008 — not to grow a big business, but to ensure the people in our village had access to clean, hygienic, and pure grains.</p>
    <p>Over time, his concern shifted to spices — often mixed with chemicals, colorants, and harmful preservatives. So he began grinding spices himself — one batch at a time — to protect our plates and our people.</p>
    <p>Years later, his son — a naturopathy doctor with international experience — returned home, shocked to learn how even certified products contained slow poisons. Another son, a mechanic and video editor, returned from Dubai to explore India’s spice landscapes and reconnect with roots. The youngest supported with sourcing and farmer connections.</p>
    <p>Together, we created SNM Spices — a brand built on truth, trust, and health.</p>
